👋 Hey there, I’m Neetu Naikya!

👀 **Interests:**

* Python 🐍, C++ ⚙️, JavaScript ✨
* Web development magic 🎩✨
* Exploring the mysterious lands of AI 🤖 (a.k.a. teaching computers to think… sort of)

🌱 **Currently Leveling Up In:**

* Python, C++, JavaScript
* Crafting **responsive & creative** websites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and using AI tools .
* Learning how to make websites so responsive they text you back faster than your crush. 💌

* Or anything that involves building cool stuff and having a few laughs along the way 😄

📫 **Find Me Here:**
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/neetu-naikya) — because even code wizards need a professional hat 🎩

💡 **Fun fact:** I believe `404` should mean *“Fun Not Found”* — so I try to keep my projects 100% bug-free… *most of the time*.
